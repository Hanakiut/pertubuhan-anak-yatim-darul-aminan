	  The Darul Aminan Orphan Organization (PAYDA) was founded on November 30, 2005, and it received approval to register as an organisation on December 30, 2005, 
       in accordance with Section 7 of the Organization Act of 1996. It is a voluntary subsidiary organisation tasked with ensuring the care of orphans in state 9.
       There are currently 34 orphans living with the Darul Aminan Orphan Organization and attending school (PAYDA). These kids are housed in three homes in the Gedong Lalang Ampangan 
       neighbourhood of Seremban. The homes have been transformed into a dorm space outfitted with a variety of tools, particularly for education.
       Children between the ages of 3 and 17 who are enrolled in school make up the group of orphans brought to reside at the Darul Aminan Orphan Organization (PAYDA). 
       These kids are chosen from families that really need aid and from those who have lost one or both of their fathers.This organisation has 3 residence halls, one of which is Saidatina Humairah,
       which houses female students. The hub of all activities takes place at this hostel, which serves as both an administrative unit and a centre. Boys and girls from this organisation learn and
       eat together here as well. Male students are housed in the two additional dorms, Saidina Hassan and Saidina Hussin. While Saidina Hussin hostel is a property donated for short-term use by a 
       servant of God, Saidina Humairah hostel and Saidina Hussan hostel are residences that locals have rented to this organisation. A supervisor is assigned to each hostel to keep an eye on and care for them.</p>
